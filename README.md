## Project Overview & Research Question
This project investigates whether an **inverted yield curve** (10-Year minus 2-Year Treasury spread) is a reliable leading indicator of U.S. recessions compared to alternative early-warning signals such as:
- Declining crude oil prices
- Negative consumer sentiment trends
- Sharp S&P 500 declines

**Definition of Recession (target variable):**  
Two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth
